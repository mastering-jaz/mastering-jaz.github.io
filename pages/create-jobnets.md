# <i class="fa fa-list-alt"></i> Creating Jobnets

In JAZ, nothing happens without a jobnet.

A jobnet is a flow chart like diagram created using various icons.

This jobnet define what to do on which server, do this, do that etc.

Normally, many small independent jobnets are created and finally all of those are combined to form a JobNet.

Following image shows a publicly created jobnet.

These created jobnets are used in **[schedules]({{ site.url }}/create-schedules/)** to be run.
