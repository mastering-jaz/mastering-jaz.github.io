# <i class="fa fa-line-chart"></i> Creating Schedules

This is one of the core part of the job scheduling software.

Without schedules, nothing happens efficiently.

Two type of jobnets are available:

*   **Public Schedules:** These are visible and usable to all users.
*   **Private Schedules:** These are visible only to same access group.


Create a schedule to run **[Jobnets]({{ site.url }}/create-jobnets/)** on the dates specified in **[Calendars]({{ site.url }}/create-calendars/)**.
